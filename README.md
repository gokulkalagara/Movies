## Tech Stack 
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/) - Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI, simplifying and accelerating UI development on the platform. It allows for creating beautiful and responsive UIs with less code.
- [Clean Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - This software architecture pattern emphasizes decoupling between components, leading to a modular, testable, and scalable application. It facilitates a clear separation of concerns across different layers of the app.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - The preferred programming language for Android development, known for its expressive syntax and enhanced safety features, which streamline app development.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - A dependency injection library built on Dagger, Hilt simplifies the process of integrating dependency injection into your Android applications, promoting better code reusability and testability.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Kotlin's feature for asynchronous programming, allowing for efficient execution of code without blocking the main thread, crucial for smooth user experiences in Android apps.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - A suite of libraries that help design robust, maintainable, and testable applications. This includes foundational components like ViewModel and LiveData that manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - A component that holds and manages UI-related data in a way that survives configuration changes like screen rotations, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - A collection of customizable and modular UI components based on Google’s Material Design guidelines, helping to create a consistent and engaging user interface.
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - A JSON library used to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa, simplifying data serialization and deserialization processes within the app.
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, enabling seamless communication with RESTful web services and making network requests more manageable.
- [OkHttp Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) -  A logging interceptor for OkHttp, used to log HTTP request and response data, aiding in debugging network interactions.
- [ROOM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
